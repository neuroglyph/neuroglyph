# Test Infrastructure Reorganization

## Changes Made (2025-06-14)

### 1. Updated docker-compose.yml
- Changed test service command from `./tests/integration/test.sh` to `./tests/integration/run-all-tests.sh`
- This ensures all test suites run when using `docker compose run test`

### 2. Added Docker Guards
Added Docker guard checks to all test scripts (except Docker runners):
- test-all.sh
- test-depth-error.sh
- test-minimal.sh
- test-path-validation.sh
- test-regression.sh
- test-traverse-debug.sh
- test-traverse-simple.sh
- test-traverse-ultra-simple.sh
- test-traverse.sh

Docker runners that don't need guards (they create containers):
- docker-test.sh
- fuzz-test.sh
- valgrind-test.sh

### 3. Updated test-all.sh
- Now delegates to run-all-tests.sh instead of running individual tests
- Provides a consistent entry point that matches run-all-tests.sh

### 4. Fixed File Permissions
Made the following scripts executable:
- test-minimal.sh
- test-traverse-debug.sh

### 5. Added Documentation
- Created tests/README.md with comprehensive test infrastructure documentation
- Documents test structure, Docker guards, running tests, and principles

## Test Execution Flow

```
make test (from root)
  └─> docker compose run test
      └─> run-all-tests.sh (in container)
          ├─> test.sh (core commands)
          ├─> test-traverse.sh (graph traversal)
          ├─> test-path-validation.sh (security)
          ├─> test-regression.sh (bug fixes)
          ├─> test-depth-error.sh (edge cases)
          └─> valgrind-test.sh (if available)
```

## Key Improvements

1. **Consistency**: All tests now run through a single entry point
2. **Safety**: Docker guards prevent accidental execution on working repo
3. **Clarity**: Clear documentation of test structure and purpose
4. **Completeness**: docker compose now runs ALL tests, not just basic ones
