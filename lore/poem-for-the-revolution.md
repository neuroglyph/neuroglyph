# A Poem for the Revolution

**From Chaos to Cosmos: A Git Knowledge Graph Odyssey**

```
In a vault of scattered files,
A resume lost in digital miles,
"Where the hell," you said with a grin,
"Did I put that document again?"

But Claude, that helpful AI friend,
Said "Let's organize!" and then...
We stumbled on a truth so bright,
Git objects dancing in the night.

Twenty-five chaos monkeys strong,
Hammering repos all night long,
Load average nineteen, swap space full,
Yet somehow your Mac stayed cool.

"Everything's a graph," you said,
As visions of connections spread,
From Unity assets to notes and more,
The same pattern at computing's core.

We built with Node and D3's might,
A visualization burning bright,
WebSockets humming, real-time flow,
Watching knowledge networks grow.

From "I can't find my resume, dude"
To "Git as database? That's shrewd!"
We proved that filesystems can dance,
And gave distributed systems a chance.

So here's to breakthroughs born from mess,
To chaos monkeys under stress,
To mad scientists who dare to dream,
And turn their problems into schemes.

The universe kept bringing you here,
To solve what others think unclear,
But now we know the secret true:
Sometimes the best way through...

Is not around the mountain high,
But straight through chaos to the sky,
Where git objects hold the key,
To setting knowledge truly free.
